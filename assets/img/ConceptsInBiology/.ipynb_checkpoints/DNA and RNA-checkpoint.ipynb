    "    2. As helicases separate the two DNA strands, another enzyme, __DNA polymerase__ helps attach new, incoming DNA nucleotides one at a time onto the surface of the exposed strands. Nucleotides enter each position according to base-pairing rules.\n",
    "    3. In prokaryotic cells, this process starts at only one place along the cell’s DNA molecule. This place is called the origin of replication. In eukaryotic cells, the replication process starts at the same time in several different places along the DNA molecule. As the points of DNA replication meet each other, they combine and a new strand of DNA is formed. The result is two identical, double-stranded DNA molecules.\n",

    "- When an incorrect match is detected, _DNA polymerase_ removes the incorrect nucleotide and replaces it. \n",

    "- __Messenger RNA (mRNA)__ carries the blueprint for making the necessary protein. \n",

    "\n",
    "- A __codon__ is a set of three nucleotides that codes for the placement of a specific amino acid.\n",
    "- Each codon combination has corresponding amino acid.\n",
    "- There are 64 possible codons and only 20 commonly used amino acids, so there are multiple ways to code for many amino acids.\n",

    "- __Initiation__ \n",
    "    - The small ribosomal subunit moves along the mRNA and stops at the first AUG codon on the length of the RNA.\n",
    "    - This AUG codon is where translation begins. At the first AUG codon, the first amino acid (methionine, or MET) is positioned on the mRNA.\n",
    "    - Amino acids are taken to the mRNA-ribosome complex by transfer RNA. The portion of the tRNA that interacts with mRNA is called the anticodon.\n",
    "- __Elongation__ \n",
    "    - A ribosome is like an assembly line that organizes the steps of a complicated assembly process.\n",
    "    - For each new amino acid, a new tRNA arrives at the ribosome with its particular amino acid. The ribosome adds the new amino acid to the growing protein.\n",

    "###Controlling Protein Quality \n",

    "- __Introns__, do not code for proteins.\n",
    "- __Exons__, which are used to code for protein.\n",
    "- The introns in the mRNA are cut out and the remaining exons are spliced together, end to end, to create a shorter version of the mRNA. It is this shorter version that is used during translation to produce a protein.\n",
    "- One advantage of having introns is that it is possible to make several different proteins from the same protein-coding region by using different combinations of exons. \n",

    "    - __Missense Mutation__: A missense mutation is a point mutation that causes the wrong amino acid to be used in making a protein.The shapes and chemical properties of enzymes are determined by the correct sequence of various types of amino acids. Substituting one amino acid for another can create an abnormally functioning protein. \n",
    "    - __Silent Mutation __: The shapes and chemical properties of enzymes are determined by the correct sequence of various types of amino acids. Substituting one amino acid for another can create an abnormally functioning protein. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Insertions and deletions are different from point mutations because they change the DNA sequence by adding and removing nucleotides. \n",
    "- An __insertion mutation__ adds one or more nucleotides to the normal DNA sequence. This type of mutation can potentially add amino acids to the protein and change its function. \n",
    "- A __deletion mutation__ removes one or more nucleotides and can potentially remove amino acids from the protein and change its function. \n",
    "    - __Frameshift Mutations__: occur when insertions or deletions cause the ribosome to read the wrong sets of three nucleotides. \n",

    "    ![frameshift](/images/frameshift.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - __Mutations Caused by Viruses__: Some viruses can insert their genetic code into the DNA of their host organism. When this happens, the presence of the new viral sequence may interfere with the cells’ ability to use genetic information in that immediate area of the insertion.\n",

    "###Chromosomal Aberrations\n",
    "\n",
    "A __chromosomal aberration__ is a major change in DNA that can be observed at the level of the chromosome.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of aberrations: \n",
    "\n",
    "- An __inversion__ occurs when a chromosome is broken and a piece becomes reattached to its original chromosome, but in a flipped orientation. \n",
    "- A __translocation__ occurs when one broken segment of DNA becomes integrated into a different chromosome.\n",
    "- __Duplications__ occur when a portion of a chromosome is replicated and attached to the original section in sequence. \n",
    "- __Deletion__ aberrations result when a broken piece becomes lost or is destroyed before it can be reattached. All of these aberrations are considered mutations. Because of the large segments of DNA that are involved with these types of mutations, many genes can be affected. \n",
