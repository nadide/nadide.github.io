## JSON
We are limited when it comes to subclasses of tabular data. Sometimes our data includes one or more subclasses inside the one field. We may add exceptions into csv or other types but it is not logical to define it everytime. It's when JSON data type comes in. 

In JSON:

 - Items may have different fields.
 	- We can avoid complications with using lists to show every field for one item.
 - May have nested objects
 - May have nested lists as well

You can access the data in JSON format via connecting into the a web server with get request. Here is the sample code to get JSON from the web.

```Python 
import json
import requests

# Corresponding UrL
URL = " http://musicbrainz.org/ws/2/artist/5b11f4ce-a62d-471e-81fc-a69a8278c7da?inc=aliases&fmt=json"

# Specifiying the type of the query
query_type = {  "simple": {},
                "atr": {"inc": "aliases+tags+ratings"},
                "aliases": {"inc": "aliases"},
                "releases": {"inc": "releases"}}

def query_site(url, params, uid="", fmt="json"):
    params["fmt"] = fmt
    r = requests.get(url + uid, params=params)
    print "requesting", r.url

    if r.status_code == requests.codes.ok:
        return r.json()
    else:
        r.raise_for_status()

def query_by_name(url, params, name):
    params["query"] = "artist:" + name
    return query_site(url, params)


def pretty_print(data, indent=4):
    if type(data) == dict:
        print json.dumps(data, indent=indent, sort_keys=True)
    else:
        print data


def main():
    results = query_by_name(URL, query_type["simple"], "Nirvana")
    pretty_print(results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

We can also add more filters to get less data about our interest.

```Python
# Prints out the artist names
artist_id = results["artists"][1]["id"]
print "\nARTIST:"
pretty_print(results["artists"][1])

# Prints out the first release of music
artist_data = query_site(URL, query_type["releases"], artist_id)
releases = artist_data["releases"]
print "\nONE RELEASE:"
pretty_print(releases[0], indent=2)
release_titles = [r["title"] for r in releases]

# Prints out the all titles
print "\nALL TITLES:"
for t in release_titles:
    print t

```
