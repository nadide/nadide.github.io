## XML data format
In nutshell, XML format is encoded websites. XML design has many goals to make users life easier like;

- Data Transfer : _You can transfer data via XML between different apps, programs._
- Easy to write code to READ/WRITE
- Document Validation
- Human Readable
- Supports a variety of apps. 

XML standars makes things stable for almost every app. So you don't have to focus on data type more. You focus app more. XML can be transfer into different type as well such as pdf, html. XML format is very likely to tree structure. 

XML elements are basic build in blocks. If you are familiar with HTML you may understand what I am talking here: 

```
<!DOCTYPE art SYSTEM "article.dtd">
<art>
   <ui>2052-1847-5-9</ui>
   <ji>2052-1847</ji>
   <fm>
      <dochead>Research</dochead>
      <bibl>
         <title>
            <p>Standardization of the functional syndesmosis widening by dynamic U.S examination</p>
         </title>
         <aug>
            <au id="A1" ca="yes">
               <snm>Mei-Dan</snm>
               <fnm>Omer</fnm>
               <insr iid="I1"/>
               <email>omer@extremegate.com</email>
            </au>
```

> Having key-value realtion to represent date is very flexible and useful in Python language. 

Parsing xml is a little bit more complex. To understand the XML parsing in Python I highly recommend you to read and try to implement some examples in PythonXml library. Follow up with reading the commends in the code:

```Python

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET # This is the library that we will use for xml parsing.
import pprint

# creating an object by using ET and start to parse it
tree = ET.parse(fileName)

# get the root and assing it into root variable
root = tree.getroot()

# Prints every children of the specified root.
print "\n Children of root:"
for child in root:
	print child.tag # Prints childs tags

# But we wont get every single element in the xml because we just requested roots children. In XML childrens have children as well. We get into one level deeper. aka direct children elements of the root.
```

But if we want to extract some element which is children of some other childrens of root, then what? XML supports path expressions as well. ('./fm/bibl/title') <-  in this example we have seen that we went though the fm bibl then reached the title element. 

```Python
# Using find method to find the path follows. (Remember! We have defined root above.)
title = root.find('./fm/bibl/title')
title_text = ""
# Iterate over all the children of the title
for p in title:
	
	# simply takes the text of each element of title and concatenate into title_text
	title_text += p.text # .text is another attribute which gets the text.
# Prints the title_text in following format
print "\nTitle: \n", title_text

```
In following piece of script we will find email addresses of all authors of the paper. 

```Python
print "\nAuthor Email Addresses:"
# Go till au and iterates over au's children
for a in root.findall('./fm/bibl/aug/au'):
	# we trying to find elements with tag names ('email'), so store it
	email = a.find('email')
	# if we get what we want
	if email is not None:
		# Print it.
		print email.text
```
