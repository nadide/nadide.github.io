## Introduction

This GitHub project that one of the ongoing project of [NAU ACM Chapter](https://github.com/NAU-ACM) aim to guide people in competitive programming. 

This project developed to learn algorithms for using in competitive programming, __but also can be used for__:

- Competitive Programming
- Practicing for Interviews
- Improving Algorithmic Thinking
- Practicing for College Class
- FUN !!
 
The project is offering __a week-by-week processing curriculum__ that includes essential data structures and algorithms. 
Each week has three parts to follow:

- __Sources__ to learn basic of algorithm
- __Source codes__ to find out more
- __Questions__ to practice it 


The project provides collections of good sources about each algorithm. In time, __blog tutorials__ will be added by synthesizing these sources, so you can take advantage of learning in one place. 

The project also provide __different contributors' codes__. After you try by your own you can go and see different approaches in same problem. 

The well-developed curriculum is easy to __follow up and learn__. The only thing you will do is to follow curriculum week-by-week.


The course __requires__:
- To know at least one programming language well.
- You have to be familiar with some of the basic Data Structures (Array, Stack, Queue, etc.) 

##### PS: In the course mostly we used C, C++ and some Java. But still you can follow the curriculum without any prior knowledge of these languages
