*Algorithm* is an answer to "how to do it?" . Whatever you want, you can say as a task instand of 'it'. Algorithm defines any kind of steps for performing task. You have a algorithm for cooking egg even you don't know, and certainly more detailed than "Take egg and cook it." If you ever code something, imagination is getting start to appear in your mind how to describe it with a hundred commands. Actually, computer algorithms based on algorithms that human brain uses on any task.
